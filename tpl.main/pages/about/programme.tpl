	<p>The actions should take place at and around your school or within the nearby community, and can be initiated by a class or a club at your school.</p>
	<p>Each performed action should be reported to Life-Link <a href="{$uri.report}">online</a> or by mail, fax or E-mail. By sending your school's first Action Report, the school will join the Life-Link network and it will be listed under our <a href="{$uri.friendship_schools}">Schools &amp; Actions</a>.</p>
	<p></p>

			<p>Once your school is registered, you can study if other schools in the world have performed similar care actions. Just search under our <a href="{$uri.friendship_schools}">Schools &amp; Actions</a>.</p>
			<p>You might be interested to contact others performing similar actions. Share your experience! Contact them directly using the contact information on their school page!</p>

	<p>We stress the importance that your first approach takes into consideration a time-limited collaboration (e.g. 1-2 months), and the type of communication you want to carry out. A partner-schools' collaboration benefits greatly from good planning and <a href="{$uri.project_management}">Project Management</a>.</p>
	<p>This approach can have a &quot;spin-off effect&quot; and it can lead to a prolonged collaboration. Individual pen-pal contacts can grow out from partner-schools contacts, and they can continue after the latter have finalised. You might also benefit from networking several schools around the same topic of interest.</p>
	<p>It is up to your school to discuss such extended programmes. But before going into any partner-schools programme or networking, Life-Link advocates small peace and care actions to be performed at and around your school!</p>
	<p>The Life-Link Friendship-Schools programme needs no specific application form or entrance fee!</p>
	<h1 class="simple">Just <a href="{$uri.actions}">perform one action</a> and <a href="{$uri.join}">join</a>!</h1>
