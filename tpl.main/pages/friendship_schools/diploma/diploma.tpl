    <p>In practice, here are some proposals for how to plan and perform an annual I Care Recognition – Diploma "all school" ceremony, preferably an outstanding ceremony, but the school decides on the format.</p>

    <p>Appoint a small <em>I Care Recognition</em> committee</p>
    <ul>
    <li>to promote awareness of the I Care Recognition at school,</li>
    <li>to inspire students, teachers and staff to formulate and send in proposals for candidates,</li>
    <li>to scrutinize the sent in proposals and to appoint the year’s qualified students / teacher,</li>
    <li>to plan for the official ceremony at the school. NB this is a Recognition with a Diploma, and not any financial award. Still the school might add some financial resources to the Diploma, in order to facilitate for small scholarships or field-study visits etc.,</li>
    <li>to report the results at school annual report and local news and media.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hand to each qualified student/educator:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>one Cover Sheet that has been designed by a young artistic student girl Cecilia, 15 years old, nice for framing at home or collected in the Curriculum Vitae documentation.</li>
    <li>one Personal Document with a short individual explanation and motivation for the recognition. The school will of course add its name and logo. Signatures by representatives from School board and also from Students school association</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both the cover sheet and the personal document can be downloaded from <a href="{$uri.files}diplomas">here</a>.</p>

		<h1>Background</h1>
		<div class="justify">
			<p>The idea of an I Care Recognition at schools world-wide was introduced in Sweden, 11 November 2011 ( 11-11-11 !) by Life-Link board members Maria and Hans. It builds on the Life-Link ethics of <a href="{$uri.care_for_myself}">Care for Myself</a> – <a href="{$uri.care_for_others}">Care for Others</a> – <a href="{$uri.care_for_nature}">Care for Nature</a> and <a href="{$uri.lets_get_organised}">Let's Get Organised</a>. It was for the first time introduced with most positive reactions at the Sigtuna SSHL school in Sweden in May 2012, and has since then been discussed at the Life-Link international RRR conference in August 2012.</p>
