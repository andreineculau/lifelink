	<h1>Project Management</h1>
	{include file="/obj/byline.tpl"}
	<h3 class="center"><em>by</em> Mr. Wijnand Dickhoff, The Netherlands</h3>
	<h2>Step 4 - Planning of activities</h2>
	<p>Defining the end results in a concrete way and the decision about the form the project will take enables the committee to begin thinking in terms of what sort of activities have to be carried out and in what sequence, in order to reach the required results. It is at this stage that planning of the project really takes off.</p>
	<p>Two important principles of project management are instrumental in the planning stages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>think before you act </li>
		<li>worl from broad to fine </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Think before you act is important, because if you do not think through beforehand what sort of activities are required in order to reach your results, you might end up by having to start several times all over again. Reasons for this can be, that you did not begin at the right point, or that you happen to disagree on the order of steps to be taken once you are underway or that you did not involve the right people, etc. More reasons can easily be added to the list.</p>
	<p>Working from broad to fine means that you first indicate in broad terms what steps need to be taken. You then develop a detailed planning for the first step and after completing this, design the next step and so on.</p>
	<p>An useful tool in project planning is to work with the five control factors:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Time</li>
		<li>Money</li>
		<li>Quality</li>
		<li>Information</li>
		<li>Organisation</li>
	</ol>

		<h1>1. Time</h1>
		<div class="justify">
			<p>Often people tend to forget to define how much time a particular project will take. A group just begins without a clear idea when things will be finished. In doing so, one runs risks such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>people give up on the project, when they get involved in other things, because they feel not committed to something that has no clear end;</li>
				<li>those who benefit from the project will build up expectations, without realising any longer all the extra time and effort that is involved; as a result they will be very upset if the committee wants to finish the project;</li>
				<li>after a certain period the inspiration is not any longer as high as before, the project might fade out by lack of committment or interest.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Setting time limits from the very beginning offers a much better guarantee that the project will be finished when spirits are still high. If there is a need or a desire for continuation it is much better to design a new project with revised goals, a fresh approach, new personnel, etc.</p>
			<p>Just as it is important to know beforehand how long a project will last, it helps to try to give an indication of the time needed for the different stages of the project.</p>

		<h1>2. Money</h1>
		<div class="justify">
			<p>Most projects that Life-Link schools take on will create some financial costs. It may be only a small amount of money or a larger sum. In all cases it is strongly recommended that the Life-Link committee makes up a budget beforehand. Again the principle of working from broad to fine holds. The committee could begin with a rough estimate of the costs involved. As more information becomes available details can be filled in.</p>
			<p>The advantage of having a budget at an early stage is that the committee can begin to look into the necessity and possibilities of fund raising. Also, a budget request can be made to the school.</p>
			<p>Related to the budget is an estimate of materials and equipment that may be necessary. Once an inventory is being made, the committee can begin to see, if materials can be had from the school or the local community. Certain items might be given by local enterprises. If this does not happen a figure has to be created in the budget.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="headingbox">
		<h1>3. Quality</h1>
		<div class="justify">
			<p>An important aspect of good quality management is that the project team tries to define quality standards regarding the results.</p>
			<p>Quality standards have to meet the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>they are quantifiable</li>
				<li>they are measurable</li>
				<li>margins are build in</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Examples of quality standards are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>we want 25% of the school population to take part in the actions during our campaign day;</li>
				<li>we want to meet 50 people during visits to homes for the elderly or street children in period so and so;</li>
				<li>we want a response of 60 % for our questionaire;</li>
				<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these quality standards are quantified and easily measured. It makes it possible to give an indication of the quality of the project in reports and articles that go out to the public. A great advantage of such quality standards is that it is very convincing once they are being fulfilled. If the targets are not reached, it will give clues for what went wrong and where improvements can be made.</p>
			<p>One caution has to be mentioned here. Do not make quality standards too rigid! Always allow margins in order to prevent frustration. Keep yourself away from becoming too fanatic!</p>

	<div class="headingbox">
		<h1>4. Information</h1>
		<div class="justify">
			<p>As soon as a project gets started considerable information flows arise. Without careful planning they get easily out of control. Sooner or later no one knows anymore what actually is going on.</p>
			<p>In order to keep track of what happens committee members need to inform each other of what each of them is doing. When subgroups are involved their work must be reported. Also, outsiders have at intervals to be informed. The committee would want a picture of who should receive which information at what time intervals.</p>
			<p>Experience clearly has shown that when a project team tries to think beforehand what sort of information needs to be collected and administered and who needs to get which information at what time, the project becomes a lot easier to manage.</p>
			<p>If for example it is specified beforehand who for a campaign day will be invited for what acitivities, it becomes much easier to send the proper information to each person and keep an eye on the response.</p>
			<p>Another example is the budget. If there is a specified budget beforehand, the treasurer can hand out money to different persons for the different items specified. Those who receive the money are requested to keep a record of their spendings and report that back to the treasurer. In this way the budget is under control.</p>

	<div class="headingbox">
		<h1>5. Organisation</h1>
		<div class="justify">
			<p>A clear organisation of the project is a great help in getting good results. Again, try at the beginning to spell out, who is involved in the project and in what capacity. Make lists of your target audience, resources, subcommittees and workgroups and specify what tasks and roles they have to fulfill.</p>
			<p>Charts and diagrams help to digest the information. With a good overview of all the functions and roles of those in charge of the project everyone knows better his/her place in the whole. For those who hear about the project or stand in functional relation to it, it is much easier to understand what takes place and what it is all about.</p>
			<p>Write down the results of your planning in terms of the logical order of steps in which you plan to carry out your project and how you will manage the five control factors (time, money, quality, information and organisation). Send a copy of your document to the school principal or delegated authority and keep one copy for each of the members of your committee.</p>
