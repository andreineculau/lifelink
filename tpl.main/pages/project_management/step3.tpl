	<h2>Step 3 - Design</h2>
	<p>The central question of the third step is to find solutions for the problem that you want to resolve or the concern you want to work on. In what way or form are we going to tackle the issue? At the first stage of this step the committee would want to generate as many possible solutions as possible. This is the creativity stage. Members of the committee hold brainstorm sessions to make inventories of ways how things could be done. Just as with finding possible projects, during the brainstorm sessions it is advisable to limit discussions and to give as much room as possible to everyone to contribute.</p>
	<p>The second stage of this step has to do with selection of the most feasible, effective and efficient solutions to the problems at hand. The goal here is to find the best solution.</p>
	<p>As a result of this step a decision is being taken as to what form the project will take. Are we going to hold a campaign, devise a questionnaire, organise visits to people, perform a piece of drama, etc., etc.?</p>
	<p>The result of the decision making will be written down on paper again and reported to the school principal or delegated authority and other parties we want to involve.</p>
