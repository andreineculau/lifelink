	Collaboration and Networking</div>
<p>When your school and your performed action(s) are listed on <a href="<{$tpl.links.home}>">www.life-link.org</a>, you can study if other schools in the world have performed <strong>similar peace action(s)</strong>. Just make a search on the website's <a href="<{$tpl.links.members}>">Schools &amp; Actions</a> and specific peace action(s).</p>
<p>Your class/club/school might be interested to <strong>contact other school(s)</strong> performing similar actions and to exchange protocols and experiences. You are allowed to take such contacts directly using any available means of communication.</p>
<p>Life-Link stresses the importance that your first approach with an other school discusses a time-limited partner-schools collaboration, perhaps &quot;2-months&quot;, and secondly what communication you want to carry out. <strong>A partner-schools' collaboration benefits from good planning, project management.</strong></p>
<p>Prolonged collaboration and projects can of course be the result, a &quot;spin-off effect&quot;, from the first contacts. Individual Pen-pal contacts can grow out from early Partner-Schools contacts, and continue after that the Partner-Schools &quot;2-months&quot; programme is finalised. Your school (class) might also benefit from networking with a few or even several other schools around a topic of interest.</p>
<p><strong>It is up to your school to discuss such extended programmes.</strong> But before going into any partner-schools programme or networking, Life-Link advocates small peace and care actions to be performed at and around your school!</p>
