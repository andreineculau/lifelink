	<h2>Dear Headmasters / Principals<br>
		and responsible Life-Link Teachers</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>We think you agree that students/pupils at your school, participating in a minimum of four (4) peace actions per year, should be recognised and awarded with a Life-Link Diploma.</p>
		<p>You can now download the Life-Link Diploma for an Active Student from our website. Introduce the students name and the name of your school, and finally sign it by Headmaster and by a Life-Link involved Teacher.</p>
		<p>School-year or Calendar-year for the minimum of four actions - no problem - you decide at your school.</p>
		<p>Welcome to use this Diploma as an additional resource for your schools peace education and in order to build further self-esteem into your students! Your reactions are welcome!</p>
