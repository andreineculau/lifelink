<div id="llpagetitle">Introduction</div>
<p>As working on cooperative projects is such an important aspect of Life-Link work and to a large extent determines the quality of the mission as a whole, somewhat more elaborate guidelines on how to manage projects have been worked out in this manual. The section borrows from social science theory about project management. Better understanding of project management theory can be of great help to do better Life-Link work at the schools.</p>
<p>A Life-Link committee at a school wants to set up a project. How will this work? In this section some ideas are presented on how the committee might work in order to receive quality results. Let us follow the committee step by step.</p>
