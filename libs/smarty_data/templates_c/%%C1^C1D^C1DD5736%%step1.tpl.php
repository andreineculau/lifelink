<div id="llpagetitle">Step 1 - How to take an initiative, get an idea?</div>
<p>You have heard about Life-Link and you like the idea. You are ready to work for it and you read that Life-Link schools work together on common projects. But where do you start?</p>
<p>The very first step is that you sit together with your committee and ask yourself:</p>
<p>&quot;What sort of concerns, needs and problems can we think of in our school or in our community, that have to do with the Life-Link aims and objectives and that we can and want to do something about?&quot;</p>
<p>Now you might have read somewhere that Life-Link wants to work for a future where all people can live safely without fear of war, a polluted environment, discrimination, etc What can your school do to bring these ambitious aims about?</p>
<p>There is a famous saying &quot;Think globally, act locally&quot;. It means that we all can do something in our own place in order to bring about a better world. Just think of what happens in your school or in your community. What can be improved? Are there problems with conflicts between groups, rights of minorities, a cleaner environment, social help for groups with problems, etc.?</p>
<p>A practical way of doing is that you ask the members of your committee to think about concerns, needs and problems that come in their mind thinking about Life-Link. Just ask them to make a list of these ideas and to bring that to a meeting.</p>
<p>At the meeting ask everybody to read out their ideas. The chairperson of the meeting lists the ideas on a large sheet of paper in order that everybody can see it. At this stage no discussion takes place. Just list the ideas and listen to what each committee member has to say.</p>
<p>After everyone has phrased his/her ideas the items on the sheet are ordered in clusters. Some of them may have to with the environment, others with human rights, again others with social problems of certain groups like for example elderly people or street children. Order them in clusters and put these on a second sheet.</p>
<p>In most instances the committee will have far more ideas than it could ever possibly handle. As a second step, then, priorities have to be defined. A useful way of doing this might be to ask the members of the committee to individually rate the items and count them all up. Other committees could prefer just to discuss this together.</p>
<p>Two criteria probably play a role:</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>what do you think is most important?</li>
		<li>what can you handle practically?</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of the discussion a decision is made on what project the committee wants to work.</p>
<p>In a following chapter you can find suggestions for Life-Link projects and campaigns. These might give you ideas of what you can do at your school.</p>
<p>It is important that from the very beginning the school principal knows about the Life-Link work in the school. We recommend that after each step that we describe in this section you inform the principal or the person or group to whom he has delegated authority that you completed this step. Do this in written form.</p>
<p>This procedure has the following advantages:</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>the school authorities are informed</li>
		<li>you are sure that the school authorities agree on what you are doing</li>
		<li>you keep track for yourself about where you are in the project, all members of the committee share the same information</li>
		<li>it is easy to extract from the reports information that you can use in articles in the school bulletin or in local newspapers</li>
		<li>if school authorities are informed they are motivated and it probably will be easier to get access to funds and facilities of the school</li>
		<li>if the school community hears regularly about your project it will become an accepted activity in the school, making your chances for good support, once results are achieved, much higher.</li>
	</ul>
