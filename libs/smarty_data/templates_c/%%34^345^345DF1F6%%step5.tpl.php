<p>After all the thinking and planning, time finally has come to actually carry out the project. All the foregoing work derives its meaning from this step. Execution of the project will run smoother to the extent the preparatory steps have been done well. Here the principle 'think before you act' will pay off. Execution of the project will be finished when it can be shown that all the required results have been reached within the scheduled time limits.</p>
